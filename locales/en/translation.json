    "subtitle": "Fast and accurate molecular design simulations assisted by AI",
    "description_1": "Chemistry simulations are time consuming and complicated to prepare. Our goal is to make the design process easier and fast. We use AI to train general Hamiltonians for chemistry simulations that can be executed efficiently on HPC, quantum computers, and on simulations of quantum computers.",
    "description_2": "The company also offers consulting services for training AI on datasets from fields such as chemistry, biology, materials science, and cosmology. These services are supported by physics-based kernels (e.g., quantum-mechanical kernels), enabling the development of advanced machine learning algorithms with significant predictive power.",
